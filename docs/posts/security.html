            <p><em>Note: I wrote this for non-technical friends and
            family. I am not a security expert by any means but I often
            find myself advising folks on baseline practices that will
            keep you singificantly safer online.</em></p>

            <ol type="1">
            <li>Don’t reuse passwords between accounts</li>
            <li>Use a password manager (like <a
            href="http://1password.com">1password</a>) to generate and
            store long and unique passwords for <em>each
            account</em>.</li>
            <li>Turn on two factor authentication (2FA) anywhere that
            you can.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That’s it. Keep reading for the longer version.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>Most “hacks” of your email or social media accounts are
            due to individuals reusing the same password again and again
            and again between sites.</p>
            <p>Go visit <a
            href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to
            see if your email has been included in a data breach. Note
            that <em>if it has</em> (which is very likely), it has
            nothing to do with your own security practices; those
            breaches are due to companies having poor security practices
            that allows hackers to access internal systems.</p>
            <p>These data breaches often include personally identifiable
            information (name, address, phone number, etc) but sometimes
            also include passwords. So what happens if you reuse the
            same password everywhere and it was included in a
            breach?</p>
            <figure>
            <img
            src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_hacking_works.png"

            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">xkcd: How Hacking
            Works</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now that password can be attempted against other
            accounts: email, paypal, facebook, etc. And without taking
            extra steps, it’s not trivial for someone to get into these
            important accounts and do damage.</p>
            <h2 id="what-to-do-about-it">what to do about it</h2>
            <p>Use strong and unique passwords combined with two factor
            authentication (2FA). That’s it. Doing so will make you
            <em>significantly</em> more secure on the internet.</p>
            <h3 id="what-makes-a-password-strong">What makes a password
            strong?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>length (&gt; 16 characters, ideally longer)</p></li>
            <li><p>complexity</p></li>
            <li><p>impersonal (no dates, initials, names, nicknames,
            etc)</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>But the greatest of these is length:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><code>uP4d*83</code> &lt;– cracked in <a
            href="https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/">minutes</a></li>
            <li><code>ball coffee charter kidnap outlet</code> &lt;–
            cracked in centuries</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="unique-passwords">Unique Passwords</h3>
            <p>Do <u><strong><em>NOT</em></strong></u> reuse passwords
            for accounts connected to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>email</strong>: email is the key to the castle
            since someone can reset nearly all other passwords if they
            have access to your email</li>
            <li><strong>banking</strong>: bank, paypal, taxes,
            investments, venmo, etc - this is your money, protect
            it!</li>
            <li><strong>retail</strong>: Amazon, online shopping, or
            <em>anywhere</em> where you’ve submitted and stored credit
            card info</li>
            <li><strong>social media</strong>: Facebook, Instagram,
            Twitter, LinkedIn, etc - these may seem less important, but
            if they’re hacked they can be used for social engineering to
            get access to more important accounts or for trying to scam
            people that trust you</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="two-factor-authentication-2fa">Two Factor
            Authentication (2FA)</h3>
            <p>In addition to a password, you can add a second factor to
            better prove your identity when logging in. After you submit
            your password, you’ll be asked to submit another piece of
            information that only you would have. Examples, ordered from
            best to worst:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>hardware security key, like <a
            href="https://www.yubico.com/products/">yubikey</a> (best,
            but most technical)</li>
            <li>phone key (not SMS)</li>
            <li>authenticator code</li>
            <li>phone SMS code</li>
            <li>email code (worst)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Configure two factor authentication on all important
            accounts where available and be <u><em><strong>very
            weary</strong></em></u> of accounts where two factor is not
            available.</p>
            <h3 id="passwords-managers">Passwords Managers</h3>
            <p>A good password manager solves two of the three baseline
            practices: strong and unique passwords.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>it lives in your browser and on your phone</li>
            <li>it can generate complex passwords that are unique per
            website</li>
            <li>it fills passwords in the browser for you</li>
            <li>BUT it is the key to the castle so make sure this is
            very secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I recommend <a
            href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, but <strong>a
            serious and entirely valid alternative</strong> (especially
            for the tech averse): pen &amp; paper (just make sure
            passwords are long and unique).</p>
            <h3 id="additional-practices">Additional Practices</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>update your devices and browser regularly so that
            security updates are installed.</li>
            <li>use a <em>strong</em> password / pin on your computer
            and phone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Read more tips at <a
            href="https://1password.com/cybersecurity-101/">1password.com</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="parting-words">Parting Words</h2>
            <p>This can all feel intimidating, but it’s worth it. You
            will have better peace of mind knowing that your internet
            identity and assets are more secure. When you get that alert
            at 11pm that someone is trying to reset your password on
            Facebook, you can ignore and rest easy knowing that they
            won’t be able to.</p>
            <p>A bit of advice: don’t try and fix everything all at
            once. Start with your email, then try your banks, etc and do
            so incrementally. If you have any questions or feedback,
