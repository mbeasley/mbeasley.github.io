            <p>Below are some of the books I’ve read recently and some
            brief notes about them to help jog my memory. I try to
            update this list from time to time, but for a more complete
            list, you can view my reading list on <a

            <p><strong>tl/dr;</strong> IT Operations are more similar to
            manufacturing than you would suspect; and as a result, many
            of the same lessons that we have learned in manufacturing
            over the past century can be easily and effectively
            translated to IT operations.</p>
            <h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>There are four types of work: business project, internal
            projects, changes, and unplanned work. Learn what types of
            work you’re doing and create visibility of all of it -
            especially the unplanned work.</li>
            <li>Just like in manufacturing, WIP is the enemy of
            velocity; limit WIP.</li>
            <li>Follow the three ways:
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Flow</li>
            <li>Feedback</li>
            <li>Continuous Learning / Improvement</li>
            </ol></li>
            </ul>

            Coaching Habit</a></h2>

            <p><em>by Michael Bungay Stanier</em></p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>tl/dr;</strong> Advice is overrated and not
            actually as helpful as people think. Use very targeted
            coaching habits to help individuals solve problems
            themselves and, in turn, grow from doing so.</p>
            <h3 id="key-takeaways-1">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Practice habits for coaching when faced with specific
            triggers, interactions, and situations - and use these new
            habits to replace less useful habits.</li>
            <li>Use the seven coaching questions to start removing
            yourself as the problem solver and coaching others towards
            solutions:
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The Kickstart Question: What’s on your mind? </li>
            <li>The AWE Question: And what else? </li>
            <li>The Focus Question: What’s the real challenge here for
            you? </li>
            <li>The Foundation Question: What do you want? </li>
            <li>The Lazy Question: How can I help? </li>
            <li>The Strategic Question: If you’re saying Yes to this,
            what are you saying No to? </li>
            <li>The Learning Question: What was most useful for
            you?</li>
            </ol></li>
            </ul>

            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23275060">The 15
            Commitments of Conscious Leadership</a></h2>
            <div class="book-details">
            <p><em>by Jim Dethmer et al.</em></p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>tl/dr;</strong> Leaders are more effective when
            they lead with intention (above the line) versus reaction
            (below the line). The fifteen commitments are a framework to
            shift your perspective above the line.</p>
            <h3 id="key-takeaways-2">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>The 15 commitments build from low-level principles to
            higher-level principles that govern how we relate to
            ourselves, our communities, and our work.</li>
            <li>One of the perspectives that stuck out the most for me
            was deficit vs abundance or sufficiency thinking.</li>
            <li>The first step in cultivating any formation of the
            commitments is building up in-the-moment or
            near-in-the-moment awareness and mindfulness of your current
            disposition. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>by Camille Fournier</em></p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>tl/dr;</strong> Pragmatic advise at different
            levels of leadership and management; less of a thesis and
            more of a manual.</p>
            <h3 id="key-takeaways-3">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Re-visit relevant content for where you’re at in your
            career periodically; consider the levels adjacent to you as
            well so you can better understand / remember their
            perspective.</li>
            <li>The people components really matter. It’s easy to excuse
            yourself from prioritizing the people - don’t do that.</li>
            <li>Prioritization is hard. Spend the time and invoke
            strategies for prioritization so you don’t spend limited
            time and energy on the wrong things.</li>
