            <p><em>Note: This is intended for sharing with non-technical
            individuals. I am not a security expert by any means. But
            since I work in tech, I often find myself advising friends
            and family on some basics that they can do to be safer (or
            keep their parents safer) online. What follows is a very
            basic list of best practices that will significantly improve
            baseline security.</em></p>
            <h2 id="the-short-version">the short version</h2>
            <p>Stop reusing passwords between accounts and use a
            password manager (like 1Password) to generate and store long
            and unique passwords for each account. Then, turn on two
            factor authentication (2FA) anywhere that you can. That’s
            it.</p>
            Keep reading for the longer version.

            <p>Internet security is <strong><em>hard</em></strong>:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>it is technical</li>
            <li>malicious tactics are clever</li>
            <li>it is unintuitive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But by changing a few key practices, you can signficantly
            improve your security on the internet to safeguard your
            identity and finances.</p>
            <h2 id="understanding-internet-security">Understanding
            Internet Security</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>you are not <u><em>the</em></u> target; you are
            <u><em>a</em></u> target</strong>: the internet is a vast
            ocean and you’re just one fish among many. There are “nets”
            — scams, hacks, viruses, etc. — that are everywhere, trying
            to catch anyone not practicing basic internet security. The
            goal isn’t to become invincible but rather to become a less
            appealing target by enhancing your security habits.</li>
            <li><strong>breaches are common</strong>: visit <a
            href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to
            see if your email has been compromised in a breach. If it
            has (which is likely), don’t worry — that’s an indicator of
            your internet usage but not a reflection of your personal
            security practices. Breaches don’t happen because you are
            insecure, they happen because the internet is insecure.</li>
            <li><strong>the reality of hacking</strong>: Contrary to
            popular belief and dramatized portrayals, hacking often
            involves exploiting the simplest security lapses — like
            reusing passwords. A common scenario involves a hacker
            accessing a database of user data (including email and
            passwords) from a less secure site (think of an old forum
            where you once registered) and trying those email-password
            combinations on more critical sites, such as your email
            provider where you might reuse the same password.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This all might sound scary — but it’s actually good news,
            because this a really easy problem to solve by following
            just a few basic internet security practices!</p>
            <h2 id="basic-internet-security-practices">Basic Internet
            Security Practices</h2>
            <p>Use strong and unique passwords combined with two factor
            authentication (2FA). That’s it. Doing so will make you
            <em>significantly</em> more secure on the internet.</p>
            <h3 id="what-makes-a-password-strong">What makes a password
            strong?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>length (&gt; 16 characters, ideally longer)</p></li>
            <li><p>complexity</p></li>
            <li><p>impersonal (no dates, initials, names, nicknames,
            etc)</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>But the greatest of these is length:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><code>uP4d*83</code> &lt;– cracked in <a
            href="https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/">minutes</a></li>
            <li><code>ball coffee charter kidnap outlet</code> &lt;–
            cracked in centuries</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="unique-passwords">Unique Passwords</h3>
            <p>Do <u><strong><em>NOT</em></strong></u> reuse passwords
            for accounts connected to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>email</strong>: email is the key to the castle
            since someone can reset nearly all other passwords if they
            have access to your email</li>
            <li><strong>banking</strong>: bank, paypal, taxes,
            investments, venmo, etc - this is your money, protect
            it!</li>
            <li><strong>retail</strong>: Amazon, online shopping, or
            <em>anywhere</em> where you’ve submitted and stored credit
            card info</li>
            <li><strong>social media</strong>: Facebook, Instagram,
            Twitter, LinkedIn, etc - these may seem less important, but
            if they’re hacked they can be used for social engineering to
            get access to more important accounts or for trying to scam
            people that trust you</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="two-factor-authentication-2fa">Two Factor
            Authentication (2FA)</h3>
            <p>In addition to a password, you can add a second factor to
            better prove your identity when logging in. Examples,
            ordered from best to worst:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>hardware security key, like <a
            href="https://www.yubico.com/products/">yubikey</a> (best,
            but most technical)</li>
            <li>phone key (not SMS)</li>
            <li>authenticator code</li>
            <li>phone SMS code</li>
            <li>email code (worst)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Configure two factor authentication on all important
            accounts where available and be <u><em><strong>very
            weary</strong></em></u> of accounts where two factor is not
            available.</p>
            <h3 id="passwords-managers">Passwords Managers</h3>
            <p>A good password manager solves two of the three baseline
            practices: strong and unique passwords.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>it lives in your browser and on your phone</li>
            <li>it can generate complex passwords that are unique per
            website</li>
            <li>it fills passwords in the browser for you</li>
            <li>BUT it is the key to the castle so make sure this is
            very secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I recommend <a
            href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, but <strong>a
            serious and entirely valid alternative</strong>: pen &amp;
            paper (just make sure passwords are long and unique).</p>
            <h3 id="additional-practices">Additional Practices</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>update your devices and browser regularly so that
            security updates are installed.</li>
            <li>use a <em>strong</em> password / pin on your computer
            and phone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Read more tips at <a
            href="https://1password.com/cybersecurity-101/">1password.com</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="parting-words">Parting Words</h2>
            <p>This can all feel intimidating, but it’s worth it - I
            promise. You will have better peace of mind knowing that
            your internet identity and assets are more secure. But a bit
            of advice: don’t try and fix everything all at once. Start
            with your email, then try your banks, etc and do so
            incrementally. If you have any questions or feedback, reach
